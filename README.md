<h1>TwitchTv Streamer</h1>
<p>This project is my solution for Free Code Camp's Intermediate Front End Development Project called Use the TwitchTv JSON API. The goal of the exercise is to see whether the given list of streamers are streaming or not and be able to transfer to their TwitchTv channel with pressing a button. I used <b>HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and JQuery</b> to complete it.</p>
